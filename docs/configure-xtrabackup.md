# Configure xtrabackup

All the xtrabackup configuration is done through options, which behave
exactly like standard MySQL program options: they can be specified either at
the command-line, or through a file such as `/etc/my.cnf`.

The xtrabackup binary reads the `[mysqld]` and `[xtrabackup]` sections
from any configuration files, in that order. That is so that it can read its
options from your existing MySQL installation, such as the datadir or
some of the InnoDB options. If you want to override these, just specify them
in the `[xtrabackup]` section, and because it is read later, it will take
precedence.

You donâ€™t need to put any configuration in your `my.cnf`. You can specify the options on the command-line. Normally, the only thing you may find convenient to place in the `[xtrabackup]` section
of your `my.cnf` file is the `target_dir` option. This options adds a default path to the
directory for backups.

The following is an example:

```text
[xtrabackup]
target_dir = /data/backups/
```

This manual assumes you do not have any file-based configuration for
xtrabackup and shows the command-line options.

Please see the option and variable reference for details on all the configuration options.

The xtrabackup binary does not accept exactly the same syntax in the
`my.cnf` file as the mysqld server binary does. For historical
reasons, the mysqld server binary accepts parameters with a
`--set-variable=<variable>=<value>` syntax, which xtrabackup does not
understand. If your `my.cnf` file has such configuration directives, you
should rewrite them in the `--variable=value` syntax.

## System configuration and NFS volumes

The xtrabackup tool requires no special configuration on most systems.
However, the storage where the `--target-dir` is located
must behave properly when `fsync()` is called. In particular, we have noticed
that if you mount the NFS volume without the `sync` option the NFS 
volume does not sync the data. As a result, if you back up to an NFS 
volume mounted with the async
option, and then try to prepare the backup from a different server that also
mounts that volume, the data might appear to be corrupt. Use the
`sync` mount option to avoid this issue.
