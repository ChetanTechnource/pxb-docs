Get started with [Quickstart Guide for Percona XtraBackup](..//quickstart-overview.md).

[Percona XtraBackup (PXB)](https://www.percona.com/software/mysql-database/percona-xtrabackup) is a 100% open source backup solution for all versions of Percona Server for MySQL and MySQLÂ® that performs online non-blocking, tightly compressed, highly secure full backups on transactional systems. Maintain fully available applications during planned maintenance windows with Percona XtraBackup.

This is an Innovation release. This type of release is only supported for a short time and is designed to be used in an environment with fast upgrade cycles. Developers and DBAs are exposed to the latest features and improvements. Patches and security fixes are included in the next Innovation release instead of a patch release or fix release within an Innovation release. To keep your environment current with the latest patches or security fixes, upgrade to the latest release.

## Release highlights

Percona XtraBackup 8.2.0-1 is based on MySQL 8.2 and fully supports the Percona Server for MySQL 8.2 Innovation series and the MySQL 8.2 Innovation series. This release allows taking backups of Percona Server 8.2.0-1 and MySQL 8.2.

Use the Percona XtraBackup 8.0 series to take backups of Percona Server for MySQL 8.0.x or MySQL 8.0.x. Percona XtraBackup 8.2.0-1 does not take a backup of the Percona Server for MySQL 8.0 or the MySQL 8.0.x series.

## Bug fixes

* [PXB-3003]: Percona XtraBackup discovering redo logs to parse and the server purging redo logs at the same time could cause a race condition.

* [PXB-3147]: XtraBackup failed to execute the `DO innodb_redo_log_consumer_register("PXB");` query.

* [PXB-3168]: Under high write load, the backup might fail with the "log block numbers mismatch" error.

* [PXB-3173]: The xbcloud binary was refactored to use multiple threads with a global list of files. This list did not allow users to download a subset of files.

* [PXB-3181]: The use of the `innodb-use-native-aio=true` option resulted in printing duplicate timestamps.
